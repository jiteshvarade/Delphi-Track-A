# Product Requirements Document: Delphi Reader

## Overview
Delphi Reader is a modern reading experience application that enhances article consumption with intelligent navigation, AI-powered text assistance, and an elegant dark mode interface.

## Target Users
- Knowledge workers and researchers
- Students and educators
- Content creators and editors
- Anyone who reads long-form technical content

## Core Features

### 1. Reading Trail Sidebar
**Problem**: Users lose context when reading long articles and struggle to navigate between sections.

**Solution**: An adaptive sidebar that:
- Automatically extracts h2 and h3 headings from article content
- Displays a hierarchical table of contents
- Only appears when articles have 3+ headings
- Sticks below the header while scrolling
- Enables instant navigation to any section

**Success Metrics**:
- Faster time to find specific sections
- Increased engagement with longer articles

### 2. AI-Powered Selection Actions
**Problem**: Readers need quick explanations, rephrasing, or citations without leaving the context.

**Solution**: A floating popup that appears on text selection with:
- **Explain**: Get simple explanations of complex terms
- **Rephrase**: Rewrite selected text for clarity
- **Cite**: Generate citation-ready references
- **Abortable requests**: Cancel long-running AI calls
- Floating UI positioned near selection

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduced context switching
- Increased comprehension of technical content

### 3. Dark Mode
**Problem**: Reading for extended periods causes eye strain, especially in low-light environments.

**Solution**:
- System-aware dark mode toggle
- Persistent preference via localStorage
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Optimized typography contrast in both modes

**Success Metrics**:
- Increased session duration
- Reduced bounce rate during evening hours

### 4. Activity Logging
**Problem**: Users and product teams lack visibility into feature usage and AI interaction patterns.

**Solution**:
- Centralized logging context for all user actions

**Success Metrics**:
- Better understanding of feature adoption
- Easier debugging and user support
